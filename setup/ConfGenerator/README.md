## Configuration generations

The scripts in that folder are called, automatically when starting docker containers with the provided docker-compose 
files, to create `JSON` configuration files 
for the ingestion, processing and search processes from environment variables.


#### TODO

You should actually copy and edit the provided environment files in the [all-in-one](../all-in-one) 
or [components](../components) folders.
