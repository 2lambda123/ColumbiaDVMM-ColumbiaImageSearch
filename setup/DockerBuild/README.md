## Docker build

This folder contains a DockerFile to build a docker image with all packages required for the tools.

You do no need to build the docker image, if you do not change the code of this repository, as an existing image has been 
pushed to a docker repository and will be automatically downloaded by the provided docker-compose files 
in the [all-in-one](../all-in-one) and [components](../components) folders.
